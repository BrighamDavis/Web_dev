    <h2>Brigham Davis</h2>
    <p> 
        Hello everyone! My name is Brigham Davis.
         I grew up in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains in Northern California. 
         I grew up on a small orchard tending the trees and spending all of my free time outside adventuring, 
         floating rivers, exploring creeks and riding bikes anywhere and everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am now a Data Science Major with a minor in Automotive technology hoping
        to work on driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. 
        Since going to BYU-I I have found a love for cooking, hunting, and have gotten married. 
        I have especially liked the slower paced lifestyle that Rexburg has to offer.
